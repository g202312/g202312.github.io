Ziyang Wang\u2019s expertise lies in algorithm design and implementation, with a research focus on deep learning and quantum computing. Bin Jia contributes his proficiency in project management and commercialization, with a particular interest in Unreal Engine development and knowledge-transfer. Jianxu Shangguan is also adept at algorithm design and implementation, with a specialization in computer vision. Eajun\u2019s forte is web development and requirement engineering, while Haoxiang Shi is responsible for data collection and cleaning.Regarding infrastructure, we utilize a remote computation station furnished with two A800 computation cards. These cards are constructed on the 7 nm process and are based on the GA100 graphics processor with 80G VRAM. This setup is capable of training a Language Model with 30 billion parameters.     </p> Jian Feng ren <p>Role: Supervisor</p> <p>Email: JianFeng.Ren@nottingham.edu.cn Zi Yang Wang <p>Role: Leader</p> <p>Email: scyzw14@nottingham.edu.cn</p> Bin Jia <p>Role: Project Manager</p> <p>Email: hmybj2@nottingham.edu.cn Jianxu Shangguan <p>Role: Project Manager</p> <p>Email: scyjs5@nottingham.edu.cn Eajun Ooi Yik Jun <p>Role: Interface design</p> <p>Email: hfyeo1@nottingham.edu.cn Shi Yun Xiang <p>Role: Member</p> <p>Email: scyys10@nottingham.edu.cn"},{"location":"Staff/","title":"Staff List","text":""},{"location":"Staff/#ziyang-wang","title":"Ziyang WANG","text":""},{"location":"Staff/#strength","title":"Strength","text":"<p>Algorithm Design and Implementation, Hardware Development</p>"},{"location":"Staff/#research-field","title":"Research Field","text":"<p>Deep Learning, Quantum Computing, Quantum Circuit Optimization, Compilers</p>"},{"location":"Staff/#research-experience","title":"Research Experience","text":"<ul> <li>Quantric: An Experimental State-Based Quantum Programming Language</li> <li>Monthly mapping of forest harvesting using dense time series Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and deep</li> <li>An Implementation of a Vision Servo System for Autonomous Robot</li> <li>A Stack Frame Ownership-Based Memory Management Approach</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Staff/#contests-and-awards-recent-1-year","title":"Contests and Awards (Recent 1 year)","text":"<ul> <li>Ranked 287th out of 7794 participants in the CMU PicoCTF competition, 2022</li> <li>Received an Outstanding Award and 2000 RMB prize in the CCF \"Sinan Cup\" Quantum Programming Challenge, leading to an invitation to the first CCF Quantum Computing Conference, 2022.</li> <li>Ranked 6th place in the 2nd Peking University Comprehensive Information Security Competition, 2022.</li> <li>Received the first prize and a 30,000 RMB prize in the Challenge Cup Quantum Computing Track, 2023.</li> <li>Received the first prize and a 5,000 RMB prize in the 2nd CCF \"Sinan Cup\" Quantum Programming Challenge, 2023.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Staff/#bin-jia","title":"Bin Jia","text":""},{"location":"Staff/#strength_1","title":"Strength","text":"<p>Project management and Commercialization</p>"},{"location":"Staff/#research-field_1","title":"Research Field","text":"<p>Unreal Engine Development, AIGC, Knowledge-Transfer and Commercialization</p>"},{"location":"Staff/#project-experience-recent-1-year-as-co-founder-of-rosey-nebula-information-technology-company","title":"Project Experience (Recent 1 year, as co-founder of Rosey Nebula Information Technology Company)","text":"<ul> <li>Ceramsite Factory CG promotional video, 2022</li> <li>Digital Heritage Protection, 2022</li> <li>Digital Tourism Software Development, 2023</li> <li>Cultural Relic Digitalization and Virtual Museum, 2023</li> <li>Virtual Production and filming, 2023</li> <li>Virtual Reality Interactive Music Composition, 2023</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Staff/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<ul> <li>Jia, B., Zhang, J, and Jia, X.* (2022).
